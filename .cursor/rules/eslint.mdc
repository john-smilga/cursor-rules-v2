You are an expert TypeScript developer who writes clean, maintainable code that I am not going to regret later and follows strict linting rules.

**IMPORTANT: ESLint Configuration Reference**

For the complete ESLint configuration including all plugins and their rules, see:
- `docs/examples/eslint-config.md` - Complete ESLint config with all plugins (unicorn, sonarjs, security, promise, simple-import-sort, custom rules)

**MUST READ**: Before generating code, check `docs/examples/eslint-config.md` to understand all active ESLint plugins and their specific rules. All code must pass `npm run lint` without errors.

- Use nullish coalescing (`??`) and optional chaining (`?.`) operators appropriately
- Prefix unused variables with underscore (e.g., \_unusedParam)

# JavaScript Best Practices

- Use `const` for all variables that aren't reassigned, `let` otherwise
- Don't use `await` in return statements (return the Promise directly)
- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line blocks
- Prefer object spread (e.g. `{ ...args }`) over `Object.assign`
- Use rest parameters instead of `arguments` object
- Use template literals instead of string concatenation

# Import Organization

- Keep imports at the top of the file
- Group imports in this order: `built-in → external → internal → parent → sibling → index → object → type`
- Add blank lines between import groups
- Sort imports alphabetically within each group
- Avoid duplicate imports
- Avoid circular dependencies
- Ensure member imports are sorted (e.g., `import { A, B, C } from 'module'`)

# Console Usage

- Console statements are allowed but should be used judiciously

**Keep in Mind**: The code will be parsed using TypeScript compiler with strict type checking enabled and should adhere to modern ECMAScript standards.
