# Project Structure

Always follow the structure guide in `docs/structure/nextjs.md`. If this file does not exist, follow the patterns of the existing project.

## Key Rules

- **All file names must use kebab-case** (ESLint Unicorn requirement)
  - ✅ `login-form.tsx`, `use-login-mutation.ts`, `auth-store.ts`
  - ❌ `LoginForm.tsx`, `useLoginMutation.ts`, `authStore.ts`
  - Exception: Next.js route files (`page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`) remain as-is

- **Features are domain-based, not route-based**
  - ✅ `features/stores/`, `features/products/`
  - ❌ `features/dashboard/stores/`

- **Components live in folders with side-by-side tests**
  ```
  features/auth/components/login-form/
  ├── login-form.tsx
  └── login-form.test.tsx
  ```

- **Routes compose features, but features don't know about routes**

When creating new features, components, queries, or stores, always check `docs/structure/nextjs.md` for the complete structure and patterns.
